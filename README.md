**Weather App**
===========
Welcome to my weather app! This project was developed as a way to demonstrate my understanding of vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and my ability to create a simple but functional web application.

This weather app allows users to enter a city name or zip code, and then retrieve current weather conditions for that location. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch data and displays it on the page. The design of the app is simple and straight-forward, using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The App is not responsive, it is designed to be viewed on the desktop.

Some of the key features of the app include:

- A form for entering a city name or zip code
- A section for displaying current weather conditions
- Simple design that is easy to navigate.

Built With
